Dear Christians,
Dear Bible ignorers and hypocrites,
Dear division causers,
Brainwashed sons and daughters,
Dear all those who thought you were better than me,
This one's for you.

I want you to smile
Smile as satan welcomes me

Those who couldn't wait to get away from me
Like high school girls waiting to gossip
All you men of god mocking and cursing
Like all the rest of you 'chosen'

Smile as I burn for all eternity
You finally have your wish,
Smile.
